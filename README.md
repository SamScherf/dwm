# Sam's fork of dwm

This is simply a fork of the suckless program dwm that has been customized
for personal use on my X200T

## Modifications 

- Vim like keybinds
- Windows key SuperKey
- Firefox start key
- System tray

## Config/Keybinds

dwm is suckless therefore the config and keybinds are all written into the 
sourcecode at config.h

In general, the management of windows is done with the super key mask while the
creation/destruction of windows is done with the super key and shift mask. For example,
resizing of windows is SuperKey + h or l (Vim bindings), while dmenu is started with
SuperKey + Shift + d and Firefox is started with SuperKey + Shift + b.
